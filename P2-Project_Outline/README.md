### Overview
Neighborhood app will be an app that allows neighborhoods to become tight knit communities. The street I
grew up on as a kid had multiple events throughout the year where neighbors could socialize and get to know
one another. My family knew everyone on our street, and were comfortable enough with each of them to pick
up the phone and give them a call at a moments notice.

That does not seem to be the case anymore. Social media such as Facebook has made the globe a much smaller place.
This is a great thing in many respects. However, this technology along with its various social pressures have
incentivized having many so called "friends" we barely know. This has cost us close relationships with those people
in our own communities.

This problem is the primary focus of Neighborhood App. It encourages individuals to foster relationships with those
within their community and will allow new neighbors to integrate to their new neighborhood more easily. It allows for
event planning within the local community. Users can view upcoming events, see who will be there, and RSVP if they
wish to go. Each neighbor will also have the option of creating a profile to share more about themselves. Profiles
will have contact information for their household as well as any helpful services they use frequently that can be
shared with neighbors newer to the area.


### Features
1. Allow users to view upcoming events, see who is going, and RSVP if desired.
2. Google maps API: users to view the location of an upcoming event on google maps.
3. Login and sign up: allow users to create profiles and login/logout
4. Admin role: User's with administrator roles can create / delete events that neighbors can then attend.
